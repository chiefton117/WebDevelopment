# Westborough High School Troubleshooting Interface


The troubleshooting interface's primary goal is to streamline all technical issues into a uniform, sanitized data structure in order to increase the efficiency of the WHS Help Desk. 

The interface guides the user down a series of increasingly specific questions in order to eliminate most basic requests from the help desk, and determine the specifics of any task that is determined to require help desk action.
